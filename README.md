# Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM

This project implements a stock price prediction system using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. It predicts the **Adjusted Closing Price** of a stock based on historical data provided in CSV format. The web application is built using **Flask** and provides an interactive interface for users to upload data and view predictions.

## Features
- **LSTM Model**: Utilizes a deep learning model capable of capturing long-term dependencies in stock data.
- **User Interface**: A simple and user-friendly web application for file uploads and predictions.
- **Scalable Design**: Easy to extend for multiple stocks or real-time predictions.
- **Visualization**: Outputs a clear, numerical prediction of the Adjusted Close price.
